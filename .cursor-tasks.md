## Checklist for Building AI Coding Agent

---

### Electron App Setup

- [x] Initialize a new Electron project (e.g., run `npm init` and install `electron`).
- [x] Configure the main process (create `main.js` or `main.ts`).
- [x] Create the main window using Electron's `BrowserWindow`.
- [x] Set up IPC communication between the main process and renderer process.
- [x] Implement Electron security best practices (e.g., context isolation, disable Node integration in the renderer).
- [x] Configure development tools and environment (e.g., hot reload, debugging).
- [x] Set up packaging/build scripts (using electron-builder or electron-packager).

---

### Playwright Setup

- [x] Install Playwright (e.g., run `npm install --save-dev playwright`).
- [x] Install required browser binaries using Playwright CLI (`npx playwright install`).
- [x] Create a basic Playwright configuration file (e.g., `playwright.config.js`).
- [x] Write a sample test script to verify browser launch and basic functionality.
- [x] Integrate Playwright tests with your Electron app as needed.
- [x] Verify the Playwright setup by running the sample test.

---

### Simple UI Setup

- [x] Create a basic HTML layout file (e.g., `index.html`) for the renderer process.
- [x] Design the layout using CSS (Flexbox or Grid) to split the window into two main sections.
- [x] **Left Section:**  
  - [x] Add a prompt input area at the top.
  - [x] Add a container below the prompt to display results.
- [x] **Right Section:**  
  - [x] Add a container for a step-by-step action list.
  - [x] Add a container below the action list for a live render of the browser (using Electron's BrowserView or an embedded iframe).
- [x] Implement JavaScript logic to handle prompt input and update the results container.
- [x] Integrate the action list with backend processes to display step-by-step actions in real time.
- [x] Connect the live browser render container with the Playwright-controlled browser instance.

---

### System Prompt and User Prompt Management

- [x] Create and store the `systemPrompt` text in a dedicated config file.
- [x] Load and inject `systemPrompt` at initialization of AI context.
- [x] Accept user input as a structured `userPrompt` for sending to the AI API.
- [x] Ensure prompts follow formatting standards (Markdown/structured JSON).
- [x] Log user and AI prompts in a timestamped conversation history (`logs/conversation.log`).

### AI Integration

- [ ] Create a wrapper for ollama for use with the AI agent.
- [ ] Implement a function to query AI (`queryAI(messages: Message[])`) with streaming output.
- [ ] Verify basic API connectivity by sending a simple test message and receiving a response.

---

### Tool System: Core Implementation

- [ ] Define a `Tool` interface with structured inputs, outputs, and execution logic.
- [ ] Implement a dynamic tool loading mechanism (e.g., scan the `tools/` directory at startup).
- [ ] Provide a method (`executeTool`) to invoke tools based on AI-generated tool calls.
- [ ] Create a simple echo tool for testing.
- [ ] Verify basic tool invocation through mock calls in REPL.

---

### Individual Tools Implementation

#### Tools Calls For Playwright

- [ ] Create a tool to initialize Playwright browser instances (`initBrowser`).
- [ ] Implement a navigation tool (`navigateTo`) for visiting URLs.
- [ ] Build page interaction tools (`click`, `type`, `select`) for interacting with elements.
- [ ] Implement an element selector tool (`findElement`) with CSS, XPath, and text-based selection.
- [ ] Create a screenshot capture tool (`takeScreenshot`) for visual debugging.
- [ ] Build a DOM inspection tool (`inspectElement`) to extract element properties and attributes.
- [ ] Implement waiting mechanisms (`waitForElement`, `waitForNavigation`) to handle asynchronous page changes.
- [ ] Create a tool for extracting page content (`getPageContent`, `extractText`).
- [ ] Implement a form submission tool (`submitForm`).
- [ ] Build a tool for handling dialogs and popups (`handleDialog`).
- [ ] Create cookie and local storage management tools (`manageCookies`, `manageStorage`).
- [ ] Implement a network request monitoring tool (`monitorNetwork`).
- [ ] Build test recording and playback functionality (`recordTest`, `playTest`).

---

### Analytics & Error Handling

- [ ] Implement basic analytics logging (session duration, commands used).
- [ ] Implement local error logging (`logs/error.log`) capturing stack traces.

---

### Logging & Auditability

- [ ] Ensure each AI action (tool execution, API call) is logged in structured logs (`logs/actions.log`).

---

### Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] Write initial tests for core CLI functionality and prompt handling.
- [ ] Write unit tests for all tools individually, including edge cases and error handling.
- [ ] Establish a GitHub Actions CI pipeline for running tests and linting checks on each PR.

---

### Documentation & User Onboarding

- [ ] Ensure the README covers installation, configuration, and basic usage.
- [ ] Add detailed documentation (`docs/`) for each CLI command, prompt conventions, and available tools.
- [ ] Provide example workflows (e.g., bugfixes, feature implementations) in the documentation.
